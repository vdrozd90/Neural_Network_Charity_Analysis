# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis

## Overview of the analysis: 

The purpose of this analysis is to help Beks create a binary classifier that is capable of predicting whether applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup.

## Results: 

### Data Preprocessing
- "IS_SUCCESSFUL" is the target variable for the model
- APPLICATION_TYPE, AFFILIATION, CLASSIFICATION, USE_CASE, ORGANIZATION, STATUS, INCOME_AMT, SPECIAL_CONSIDERATIONS, ASK_AMT, IS_SUCCESSFUL. Are considered to be the features for the model
- "EIN" and "NAME" are neither targets nor features, and have beenremoved frome the input data

### Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model
- Attempt 1 of the model contained 2 hidden layers. Hidden layer 1 had 18 neurons, and 9 in the second
- The target model performance was not achieved on attempt 1 of creating the neural netowrk model. The models accuracy was approximatley 70%
- What steps did you take to try and increase model performance?

## Summary: 
Summarize the overall results of the deep learning model. Include a recommendation for how a different model could solve this classification problem, and explain your recommendation.
